ideas for concept swapping
==========================

- individual tweets are 1x1
- people are square, 2x2 or bigger based on influence
- concepts + hashtags are 1x3, 2x6, 3x9, ...

dealing with overlap
--------------------
- no more swapping
- displaced concepts go into nearest *free* block (0 displaced)
- concepts with overlap on either end are displaced
- special symbol for "this is part of another concept up+left", "up", "left"
- when placing concepts, sum in a block and determine how many things you
  are displacing (n); divide similarity by (n + 2) or so

In order now.
- Determine where to put the concept. Displace fewer cells when possible.
- Remove all displaced cells and add the concept.
- Re-add displaced cells in places where they displace 0 things.
